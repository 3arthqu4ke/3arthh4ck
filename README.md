A small collection of some configs I used.

### 2b2tpvp.net
6ms PingBypass config I used on 2b2tpvp.net. If you Hotbar is arranged in a weird order check out
the module Sorter and its setting VirtualHotbar.

### eucc
40ms config for crystalpvp.cc. This config was thrown together quickly and has not been tested much.
